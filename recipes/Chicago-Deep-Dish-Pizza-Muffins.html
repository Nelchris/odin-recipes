            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Put down the fork and knifeâ€¦ here's a Chicago deep-dish pizza that you can actually 
                    eat by holding it in your hands! A beautiful golden crust contains a meaty, cheesy, 
                    saucy filling with Italian sausage, sweet peppers, and 3 types of cheese. The sauce 
                    and cheese char slightly on the outside as they bake, resulting in a super savory 
                    taste.

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Step 1</stong>
                        <p>
                            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Generously grease a 12-cup 
                            standard muffin pan with 2 teaspoons oil.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2</strong>
                        <p>
                            Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Pick it up 
                            from the edges to make sure it's not stuck to the surface, then cut out twelve 
                            4-inch circles. Reroll the dough to cut all 12 circles if necessary.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
                        <p>
                            Place each circle into a prepared muffin cup, making sure it's centered. Press 
                            and push dough up the sides of the cups, getting close to, but not all the way 
                            up to the top. When all circles have been placed in the muffin pan, go around 
                            one more time to push and press on each one.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 4</strong>
                        <p>
                            Put 1 tablespoon provolone cheese into each cup, followed by 1 tablespoon cooked 
                            sausage and 2 teaspoons cooked peppers. Lightly press on the fillings to compress, 
                            then top with 1 rounded tablespoon mozzarella cheese and 2 tablespoons pizza sauce,
                            pushing the sauce down gently into the fillings; it's okay that the fillings will 
                            be slightly higher than the pan. Sprinkle Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese generously 
                            over top.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 5</strong>
                        <p>
                            Bake in the upper center of the preheated oven until the tops are beautifully browned, 
                            30 to 35 minutes.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 6</strong>
                        <p>
                            Remove from the oven and cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes. Go around the edge of 
                            each muffin with a knife, then use a fork or small spatula to remove from the pan.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><stong>Step 7</stong>
                        <p>
                            Let cool on a rack for a few minutes, then garnish with parsley and serve.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            <h2>Chef's Notes:</h2>
                <p>
                    These muffins require a well-oiled pan to guarantee they won't stick. <br><br>Make sure the dough is 
                    cold since it will make it easier to work with and prevent it from rising too soon. Try the 
                    dough from my Chicago Deep-Dish Pizza recipe. Half a batch will be enough for this recipe, 
                    or use the whole batch and double this for 24 muffins.<br><br>Any of your favorite pizza ingredients 
                    will work in this recipe. Just don't use fresh mozzarella cheese as it's too moist. Use your 
                    favorite pizza sauce, or try my Homemade Pizza Sauce! You can make these ahead for a party. 
                    After Step 6, cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate. <br><br>Before your party, pop 
                    them on a sheet pan and put them in a preheated 350 degree F (175 degree C) oven until heated 
                    through, about 15 minutes.
